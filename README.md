## What to do
1. The hero and the footer section will be static.
2. Schedule section's data will be totally dynamic (given data are just an example)
3. Clicking on any conference from the conference card, will open it on a new page that contains conference details information.
4. The position of sidebars items on the conference details page should be swappable. You can use any package for drag.Â  Follow the link (https://codepen.io/siniger/pen/gOLmrob) for clarification.
5. For rearranging side menu items, you can use any third party package but if you write a js function by your own-self, it will be a plus.
6. Ideally, your implementation should be responsive.


## What to use
1. Core CSS/Tailwind CSS
2. Next.js for front-end. (Version 13.4 will be a plus.)
3. GraphQL API for data integration.
4. Using typescript will be a plus.
